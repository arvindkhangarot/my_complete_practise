# Python Conditions and If statements
# Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
#
# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b

# a = 333
# b = 200
# if a>b:
#     print("a is greater then b,b=",a)

# a = 339
# b = 33
# if b > a:
#   print("b is greater than a")
# else:
#
#     print("a greater then b")

# Elif
# The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition"
# a=22
# b=22
# if a>b:
#     print("a is greather then b")
# elif a==b:
#     print("a and b are equl")


#Else
# The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
# a = 200
# b = 333
# if a>b:
#     print("a is greater then b")
# elif a==b:
#     print("a and b are equl")
# else:
#     print("b is greather then b")


# And
# The and keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:
# a = 200
# b = 33
# c = 500
# if a > b and c > a:
#   print("Both conditions are True")

#or
# Test if a is greater than b, OR if a is greater than c:
# a = 200
# b = 33
# c = 500
# if a>b or a>c:
#     print("At least one of the conditions is True")

#not
#Test if a is NOT greater than b:
# a = 33
# b = 200
# if  not  a>b:
#     print("a is NOT greater than b")


# Nested If
# You can have if statements inside if statements, this is called nested if statements.
# a = 3
# if a>10:
#     print("above 10")
#     if a>20:
#         print("and above 20")
#     else:
#         print("not above 20")

#pass
# a = 33
# b = 200
#
# if b > a:
#   pass
i = 1
while i < 6:
  # print(i)
  # i+=1

# """def my_function(x):
#     return x+5
# my_function("x")
